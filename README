Building on Linux:

    Compile and run:

        $ scons
        $ ./mypaint

    Install:

        # scons prefix=/usr/local install

    Uninstall:

        # scons prefix=/usr/local install --clean

    Install (for packagers):

        $ scons prefix=/usr --install-sandbox=path/to/sandbox

            (NOTE: the sandbox location must be located under the
            current working directory. The above installs the main
            launch script as "./path/to/sandbox/usr/bin/mypaint".
            Use a symlink if that's too limiting.)


    Required: pygtk, python, swig, gtk, numpy, pycairo(>=1.4), libpng, lcms2

    Debian users can fetch these dependencies by running:

        # apt-get install g++ python-dev libglib2.0-dev python-numpy \
                          swig scons gettext libpng12-dev liblcms2-dev

    Recommended: a pressure sensitive input device (graphic tablet)


    Take care to update the icon theme cache for your $prefix if you're
    installing mypaint to a location which has one of these files already. If
    you install new icons, any existing icon cache must be updated too,
    otherwise MyPaint won't be able to find its icons even if it looks in the
    right place. For example for an install into /usr (which has one on most
    systems), you should run

        $ gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
        $ chmod a+r /usr/share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache

    after installation to ensure that the cache is up to date. Scons won't
    do this for you because the cache file is optional.

    If you install to /usr/local, you may need to run this instead:

        $ gtk-update-icon-cache --ignore-theme-index /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor
